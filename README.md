# Bike Kings Border Website
##  Project Overview

As part of my HNC in Web and Software Development at Edinburgh College, I embarked on another exciting project: creating the "Bike Kings Border" website, a site dedicated to showcasing and selling bikes. This project was a great opportunity to apply the skills I had honed from completing JavaScript and React courses on Udemy, further solidifying my understanding and proficiency in web development.

For the "Bike Kings Border" website, I focused on creating a dynamic and interactive experience using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I built an array of bike objects, each containing various properties such as name, type, price, and availability. Leveraging JavaScript's forEach method, I looped through these objects to render them dynamically into an HTML container, ensuring that the product listings were both comprehensive and easy to navigate.

One of the key features of the site was the product search functionality. To implement this, I used the filter method in JavaScript, allowing users to search for bikes based on specific criteria such as type or price range. This method efficiently filtered the array of bike objects, updating the displayed products in real-time as users entered their search parameters.

In addition to the search functionality, I created all animations and interactive features myself using vanilla JavaScript. This included smooth transitions, hover effects, and dynamic content updates that enhanced the overall user experience. The forEach method was instrumental in rendering the filtered results back into the HTML container. By looping through the filtered array, I dynamically updated the product listings, providing a seamless and responsive user experience.

By this point, I had also improved my design skills significantly, reaching a level I was satisfied with. I was able to replicate any design from scratch with precision and attention to detail, ensuring a polished and professional look.

Overall, the "Bike Kings Border" website was a testament to my growing expertise in frontend development. It showcased my ability to create interactive, data-driven web applications from scratch. The knowledge gained from my Udemy courses on JavaScript and React was invaluable, enabling me to tackle this project with confidence and precision. This website, much like the "Organic Me" project, marked another significant step in my web development journey.
